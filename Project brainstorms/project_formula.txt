Formula for text-as-data research 


What question do you want to answer? This should be something you *actually* want to know, and it should end in a question mark.

I'm interested in whether people who engage educational memes on instagram learn anything. I am also interested in whether neoliberalism actually means anything given. 

The only question I can think of is: How does Pitchfork review and grade music?


What source of text data will you use?

Pitchfork music reviews

What are two possible answers to the question?

Quality of music as defined by musicality or quality of vibe as defined by descriptive language in review

How will the results of the quantitative text analysis demonstrate which of those answers is correct?
